## Installation and running

Simply use `npm install` to download necessary packages

Then `npm start` to run the code. Server is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) , while listening to nanorc on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) via proxy.

Proxy can be changed in `package.json`

when you run the server via start script it is just a debug mode to test actual code. Don't consider it deployed in production as many security features would be missing
